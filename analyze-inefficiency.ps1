# Analysis script to understand the inefficiency in current MuFo album search

Write-Host "=== MuFo Search Inefficiency Analysis ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`n1. CURRENT PROBLEM:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "   - Downloads 1,121+ albums for EVERY album search"
Write-Host "   - Uses 'Get-SpotifyArtistAlbums' too frequently"
Write-Host "   - No early termination when good matches found"
Write-Host "   - Processes ALL artist albums even when first few match"

Write-Host "`n2. ROOT CAUSES:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   - Tier 1-3 queries too restrictive (0.9 confidence threshold)"
Write-Host "   - Tier 4 fallback downloads entire discography"
Write-Host "   - No query optimization for classical music naming"
Write-Host "   - No filtering by album type (includes singles, compilations)"

Write-Host "`n3. SPOTIFY API EFFICIENCY:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   - Search-Item: Fast, limited results (~50 per query)"
Write-Host "   - Get-SpotifyArtistAlbums: Slow, downloads ALL albums"
Write-Host "   - Manual search finds it quickly = Search-Item should work"

Write-Host "`n4. IMPROVED STRATEGY:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   - Use multiple targeted Search-Item queries first"
Write-Host "   - Lower confidence threshold to 0.6-0.7"
Write-Host "   - Add album name variations for classical music"
Write-Host "   - Only use artist discography as last resort"
Write-Host "   - Filter artist albums by type (albums only)"
Write-Host "   - Early termination when good matches found"

Write-Host "`n5. EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   - 10-50x faster execution (search vs download)"
Write-Host "   - Better matches due to multiple query strategies"
Write-Host "   - Less Spotify API rate limiting"
Write-Host "   - Same or better accuracy"

Write-Host "`n6. TEST PLAN:" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "   - Replace Get-SpotifyAlbumMatches in Invoke-MuFo.ps1"
Write-Host "   - Test with Arvo Pärt albums"
Write-Host "   - Compare speed and accuracy"
Write-Host "   - Run full test suite to ensure compatibility"
