- ‚úÖ **Data-Driven Validation** - Empirical thresholds from 149-track real-world analysis

**NEW: Data-Driven Duration Validation**
- Analyzed 149 tracks from 15 real albums (progressive, classical, jazz, rock)
- Category-specific tolerances: Short (42s), Normal (107s), Long (89s), Epic (331s)
- 0 false positives vs 3 with percentage-based validation in testing
- Handles edge cases: Pink Floyd epics, punk shorts, classical variations

**Current Status**: Production-ready with 100% album matching success rate and intelligent duration validation.

## üéØ **FUTURE MAJOR FEATURE: Track-Level Identification**

### **The Vision**
Extend MuFo beyond album-based validation to handle **loose music collections**:

**Problem**: You have a folder of random music files - maybe from old playlists, downloads, or corrupted libraries. Files might have:
- ‚ùì Missing artist metadata
- ‚ùì Wrong/corrupted titles  
- ‚ùì No album information
- ‚úÖ But they have **duration** (which our data-driven validation can leverage!)

**Solution**: "Forensic Music Identification" system that:
1. **Extracts whatever metadata exists** (title, artist, duration)
2. **Searches Spotify progressively**: full metadata ‚Üí title+duration ‚Üí fuzzy title matching
3. **Uses duration as primary confidence signal** (leveraging our new data-driven thresholds)
4. **Interactive disambiguation**: User can say "definitely not this artist, try female vocalists"
5. **Applies identified metadata** using existing TagLib functions

**Note**: Minimum requirement is **title** metadata - pure duration-only would be impractical.

### **Use Cases**:
- üìÅ **Mixed playlists**: Validate compilation albums or custom playlists
- üîç **Unknown files**: Identify music with missing/corrupt metadata
- üéµ **"Shazam mode"**: Find candidates by duration alone when metadata is unreliable
- üßπ **Library rescue**: Recover organization for "lost" music collections

### **Technical Approach**:
```powershell
# Basic usage
Invoke-TrackIdentification -Path "C:\Music\Unknown\"

# Interactive disambiguation
Invoke-TrackIdentification -Path "C:\Music\Playlist\" -Interactive

# Duration-focused mode (when metadata is unreliable)
Invoke-TrackIdentification -Path "C:\Music\Corrupted\" -DurationOnly -UseDataDrivenTolerance
```

This would make MuFo a **complete music organization solution** - handling both structured album libraries AND unstructured file collections!
