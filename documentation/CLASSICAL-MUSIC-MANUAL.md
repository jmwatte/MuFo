# MuFo Classical Music User's Manual

## üéº Overview

MuFo includes comprehensive support for classical music, handling the complex metadata relationships and organizational patterns unique to classical recordings. This manual covers all classical music features and best practices.

## üéª Classical Music Detection

MuFo automatically identifies classical music tracks using multiple criteria:

### Detection Triggers
- **Genre tags**: Contains "Classical" or "classical"
- **Album titles**: Keywords like "symphony", "concerto", "sonata", "requiem", "mass", "oratorio", "opera", "suite", "quartet", "trio", "duo", "solo", "recital"
- **Artist names**: Classical terminology like "orchestra", "philharmonic", "chamber", "symphony"

### Analysis Output
When processing classical albums, MuFo provides:
- `IsClassical`: Boolean indicating classical detection
- `PrimaryComposer`: Most frequent composer across tracks
- `PrimaryConductor`: Most frequent conductor across tracks
- `ClassicalTracks`: Count of classical-identified tracks
- `SuggestedClassicalArtist`: Recommended album artist

## üéº Composer & Artist Handling

### Composer Detection
MuFo extracts composer information from:
- **TagLib Composer field**: Primary source
- **Comment field**: Pattern `Composer: Name`
- **Filename patterns**: Intelligent parsing
- **Artist field fallbacks**: When explicitly marked

### Classical Artist Hierarchy
Classical music has a unique artist hierarchy that MuFo respects:

```
Composer (Album Artist) ‚Üí Primary creative force
Conductor (Track Artist) ‚Üí Performance interpretation
Orchestra/Ensemble (Track Artist) ‚Üí Performing group
Soloists (Track Artist) ‚Üí Individual performers
```

### Tag Optimization (`-OptimizeClassicalTags`)

When enabled, MuFo automatically:
- Sets composer as album artist when missing
- Preserves conductor/performer information in track artists
- Adds conductor info to comment fields
- Maintains proper classical music metadata hierarchy

## üîÑ Classical Music Workflows

### Basic Classical Album Processing
```powershell
# Standard classical album analysis
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Music\Classical\Beethoven" -IncludeTracks -WhatIf

# With classical tag optimization
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Music\Classical" -IncludeTracks -FixTags -OptimizeClassicalTags -WhatIf
```

### Safe Classical Tag Enhancement
```powershell
# Preserve existing track artists (conductors/performers)
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -FixTags -DontFix "TrackArtists" -OptimizeClassicalTags

# Full classical optimization
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -FixTags -OptimizeClassicalTags
```

### Classical Album Matching
```powershell
# Include compilations (many classical releases are "Various Artists")
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -IncludeCompilations -IncludeTracks -WhatIf

# With duration validation for track ordering
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -IncludeTracks -ValidateDurations -DurationValidationLevel DataDriven
```

## üéµ Track Numbering & Organization

### Classical Track Numbering Challenges
Classical music often uses:
- **Multi-movement works**: Single "work" spans multiple tracks
- **"00 - Title" naming**: Movement titles instead of sequential numbers
- **Complex numbering**: Disc 1/Track 1, Disc 2/Track 1, etc.

### Intelligent Track Numbering
MuFo provides special handling for classical track numbering:

1. **Spotify matching**: Matches by title similarity
2. **Duration-based fallback**: Uses track lengths for correct sequencing
3. **Data-driven tolerances**: Different accuracy levels for track lengths:
   - **Short tracks** (0-2 min): ¬±42 seconds tolerance
   - **Normal tracks** (2-7 min): ¬±107 seconds tolerance
   - **Long tracks** (7-10 min): ¬±89 seconds tolerance
   - **Epic tracks** (10+ min): ¬±331 seconds tolerance

### Box Set Handling (`-BoxMode`)
For multi-disc classical works:
```powershell
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical\Beethoven\Complete\BoxSet" -BoxMode -IncludeTracks -WhatIf
```

## üèóÔ∏è Classical Music Folder Structures

MuFo handles these common classical organization patterns:

### Composer-Centric
```
Beethoven/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Piano Sonatas/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Symphonies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ String Quartets/
```

### Performer-Centric
```
Karajan/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Beethoven - Symphony No. 5
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mozart - Requiem
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Brahms - German Requiem
```

### Work-Centric
```
Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)/
Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)/
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Classical Music

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "No matches found on Spotify"
**Problem**: Classical albums often appear as "Various Artists" compilations
**Solution**: Use `-IncludeCompilations`
```powershell
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -IncludeCompilations -WhatIf
```

#### Wrong Artist Matches
**Problem**: MuFo matches to performers instead of composers
**Solution**: Use manual artist selection or check confidence scores
```powershell
# Check available matches first
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical\Beethoven" -WhatIf

# Use manual selection if needed
Invoke-ManualTrackMapping -Path "C:\Classical\Beethoven"
```

#### Missing Composer Information
**Problem**: Classical tracks lack composer metadata
**Solution**: Use `-OptimizeClassicalTags` to extract from comments/filenames
```powershell
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -FixTags -OptimizeClassicalTags
```

#### Track Ordering Issues
**Problem**: Classical albums with "00 - Movement" naming get wrong track numbers
**Solution**: Use duration-based matching
```powershell
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -IncludeTracks -ValidateDurations -DurationValidationLevel DataDriven
```

#### Conductor Information Lost
**Problem**: Tag optimization overwrites conductor information
**Solution**: Exclude track artists from fixing
```powershell
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -FixTags -DontFix "TrackArtists" -OptimizeClassicalTags
```

## üìã Best Practices for Classical Music

### 1. Always Use Compilation Mode
```powershell
# Essential for classical music
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -IncludeCompilations
```

### 2. Enable Classical Optimization
```powershell
# For proper composer/performer separation
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -OptimizeClassicalTags
```

### 3. Preserve Performer Information
```powershell
# Keep conductors and soloists in track artists
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -DontFix "TrackArtists"
```

### 4. Use Duration Validation
```powershell
# For correct track sequencing in complex works
Invoke-MuFo -Path "C:\Classical" -ValidateDurations -DurationValidationLevel DataDriven
```

### 5. Check Analysis Output
Review these fields in the analysis:
- `PrimaryComposer`: Should match expected composer
- `PrimaryConductor`: Important for performance identification
- `ClassicalTracks`: Should match total tracks for pure classical albums

## üéº Advanced Classical Features

### Duration-Based Track Matching
MuFo uses empirical data from 149 classical tracks to set appropriate tolerances:
- **Short movements**: Tighter tolerances (¬±42s)
- **Standard movements**: Normal tolerances (¬±107s)
- **Long movements**: Relaxed tolerances (¬±89s)
- **Epic works**: Very relaxed tolerances (¬±331s)

### Classical Genre Enhancement
Automatically adds "Classical" genre when:
- Composer detected
- Classical terminology in titles
- Orchestra/ensemble artists identified

### Multi-Artist Classical Works
Properly handles complex classical metadata:
- **Composer**: Album artist (primary creative force)
- **Conductor**: Track artist (performance interpretation)
- **Orchestra**: Track artist (performing ensemble)
- **Soloists**: Track artist (featured performers)

## üìñ Classical Music Resources

### Recommended Folder Structures
- **By Composer**: `Composer/Work/Recording`
- **By Performer**: `Conductor/Composer - Work`
- **By Era**: `Baroque/Composer/Work`

### Tag Standards for Classical
- **Album Artist**: Composer name
- **Track Artist**: Conductor/Performer information
- **Genre**: "Classical"
- **Composer**: Explicitly tagged
- **Comment**: Additional performance notes

### Performance Tips
- Process classical collections in batches by composer
- Use `-WhatIf` first to review changes
- Check `PrimaryComposer` in analysis output
- Use `-DontFix "TrackArtists"` to preserve conductor info
- Enable `-ValidateDurations` for track ordering verification
