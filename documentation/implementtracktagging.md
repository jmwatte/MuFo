# Track Tagging Implementation - âœ… **COMPLETED**# Implement Track Tagging (Read-Only Groundwork)



## âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE**This step plan sets up safe, read-only track tag inspection using TagLib-Sharp, so we can validate tracks against the inferred artist/album before enabling writes later.



Track tagging functionality has been fully implemented with comprehensive read/write capabilities.## Goals

- Add a helper to read basic tags (Artist, Album, Title, TrackNumber, Year, DiscNumber, MusicBrainzIds if present).

### **âœ… Completed Features:**- Emit a concise per-track object, and integrate a summary into the album comparison results (counts/flags: missing tags, mismatched titles, etc.).

- **Get-AudioFileTags**: Fully implemented with TagLib-Sharp integration- Keep this read-only; no writes yet.

- **Set-AudioFileTags**: Complete tag writing and enhancement functionality  

- **-IncludeTracks parameter**: Integrated into Invoke-MuFo## Acceptance Criteria

- **-FixTags parameter**: Enables tag writing and enhancement- New Private function: `Get-AudioFileTags` that returns a normalized object for supported file types (.mp3, .flac, .m4a, .ogg, .wav where possible).

- **Classical music support**: Composer detection, conductor recognition- Invoke-MuFo (optional gated by `-IncludeTracks`) collects tracks per album folder and aggregates simple validation metrics:

- **Tag validation**: Completeness checking and suggestions  - e.g., `TrackCountLocal`, `TracksWithMissingTitle`, `TracksMismatchedToSpotify` (placeholder until we wire Spotify tracks).

- **Multiple audio formats**: .mp3, .flac, .m4a, .ogg, .wav support- Unit tests: mock TagLib-Sharp responses and validate our shapes and aggregation.



### **âœ… Key Parameters Implemented:**## Design

- `-IncludeTracks`: Include track tag inspection and validation- Dependency: TagLib-Sharp (documented in the manifest/readme; tests can mock).

- `-FixTags`: Enable tag writing and enhancement- Private function signature:

- `-FixOnly`: Fix only specific tag types  - `Get-AudioFileTags -Path <folder or file>` returns a list of tag objects.

- `-DontFix`: Exclude specific tag types from fixing- Normalized tag shape fields: `Path, FileName, Artist, Album, Title, Track, Disc, Year, Duration`

- `-OptimizeClassicalTags`: Classical music tag optimization

- `-ValidateCompleteness`: Check for missing tracks and issues## Step-by-step Implementation

1) Create Private/Get-AudioFileTags.ps1 with the function skeleton and basic file type filtering.

### **âœ… Integration Complete:**2) Load TagLib-Sharp via Add-Type or module requirement (document in README).

- Main workflow integration in Invoke-MuFo.ps1 (lines 400-470)3) For each supported file, read tags and map to our normalized object; handle errors with warnings and skip the file.

- TagLib-Sharp dependency management4) In Invoke-MuFo, behind `-IncludeTracks`, scan album folders and compute simple aggregates; include in output when `-ShowEverything`.

- Progress reporting for large collections5) Pester tests using mocks/fakes (donâ€™t require real audio files).

- Error handling and logging

- Classical music specialization## Notes

- Keep this safe and fast; skip large media beyond a set size threshold for now if needed.

## **ðŸ“‹ Original Implementation Plan (ACHIEVED)**- Later we can implement writes, but only after weâ€™ve validated the inference end-to-end on more data.


### **âœ… Goals - COMPLETED**
- âœ… Helper to read basic tags (Artist, Album, Title, TrackNumber, Year, DiscNumber, etc.)
- âœ… Concise per-track objects with comprehensive metadata
- âœ… Integration into album comparison results with validation metrics
- âœ… **EXPANDED**: Full read/write capabilities implemented

### **âœ… Design - IMPLEMENTED**
- âœ… TagLib-Sharp dependency integrated
- âœ… Get-AudioFileTags function: `Private/Get-AudioFileTags.ps1`
- âœ… Set-AudioFileTags function: `Private/Set-AudioFileTags.ps1`
- âœ… Normalized tag objects with rich metadata
- âœ… **ENHANCED**: Added classical music fields, composer detection, etc.

### **âœ… Step-by-step Implementation - COMPLETED**
1. âœ… Created Private/Get-AudioFileTags.ps1 with full functionality
2. âœ… TagLib-Sharp loading via Install-TagLibSharp helper
3. âœ… Complete tag reading/writing with error handling
4. âœ… Invoke-MuFo integration with -IncludeTracks and -FixTags
5. âœ… Comprehensive testing with real audio files

## **ðŸš€ Current Capabilities**
- **Comprehensive tag reading**: All standard metadata fields
- **Tag enhancement**: Fill missing titles, track numbers, years
- **Classical music optimization**: Composer/conductor handling
- **Completeness validation**: Missing track detection
- **Progress reporting**: For large music libraries
- **Error resilience**: Graceful handling of corrupted files
